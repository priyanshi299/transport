        There are many<strong><a herf="#"></a>MEANS OF TRANSPORT</strong>.</em>
      
    </p>
    
    <p>Transport in India consists of transport by land, water and air. Public transport is the primary mode of road transport for most Indian citizens, and India's public transport systems are among the most heavily used in the world.

India's road network is the second-largest and one of the busiest in the world, transporting 8.225 billion passengers and over 980 million tonnes of cargo annually, as of 2015.[1] India's rail network is the fourth largest and second busiest in the world, transporting 8.09 billion passengers and 1.20 billion tonnes of freight annually, as of 2020.[2] Aviation in India is broadly divided into military and civil aviation which is the fastest-growing aviation market in the world (IATA data).[3] India's waterways network, in the form of rivers, canals, backwaters and creeks, is the ninth largest waterway network in the world. Freight transport by waterways is highly under utilised in India with the total cargo moved (in tonne kilometres) by inland waterways being 0.1 percent of the total inland traffic in India.[4] In total, about 21 percent of households have two wheelers whereas 4.7 percent of households in India have cars or vans as per the 2011 census.[5][6] The automobile industry in India is currently rapidly growing with an annual production of over 4.6 million vehicles,[7]
 with an annual growth rate of 10.5%[5] and vehicle volume is expected to rise greatly in the future.[8]

    <p>Transport routes are the basic economic arteries of the country and that is why they are referred to as life line of the country. A well knit and coordinated 
      system of transport plays an important role in the sustained economic growth of the country.</p>

      <p>The present transport system of the country comprises several modes of transport including rail, road, shipping, air transport etc. India has great diversity in economic, social, cultural and ethnic structure and an efficient transport system is essential to bring about unity in diversity in the Indian fabric. Road and rail transport are 
        already well-developed in India and there is ample scope for the development of 
        water transport and airways.</p> 

      <p>Ocean waterways are also well developed but India lacks in the development of inland waterways. There has been good growth in airways. The Ministry of Surface Transport is responsible for the formulation and implementation of
         policies and programmes for the development of various modes of transport except railways and airways.</p>
